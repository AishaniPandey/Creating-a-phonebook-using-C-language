# Creating-a-phonebook-using-C-language
We can easily create a phonebook using C language.
The above code allows you to:
i)insert (allows you to insert roll no, name,phone no,city,email id,pincode) 
ii)display(displays all the records of phonebook)
iii)search(allows you to search on the basis of name,city,pincode)
iv)modify(modify the existing records in phonebook)
v)delete previous entered record(allows you to delete record on the basis of phone no, roll no, email id)
vi)sort records
vii)exit

A phonebook has been give here for your reference but you can create your own phonebook as well.
For execution of C file, a gcc compiler has to be installed and code can be typed in any text editer.

For executing these multiple files, following lines of code has to be typed(works for windows command prompt):
>>gcc -c main.c defns.c head.h
>>gcc main.o defns.o
>>a

Hope this helps!!
Thank you:)
